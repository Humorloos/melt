The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known. (from Diabetes Dictionary: http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/dictionary)",0

The cortex is rich in lymphocytes (thymocytes) and the medulla in epithelial cells. This gland is supplied by the inferior thyroid and internal thoracic arteries, and its nerves are derived from the vagus and sympathetic nerves. The thymus is the site of T-lymphocyte production, necessary in early life for the normal development of immunological function. The thymus reaches its greatest relative weight shortly after birth and its greatest absolute weight and maximal development at puberty. It then begins to involute resulting in a slow decline of immune function throughout adulthood.",0

Villi are projections into the lumen of the small intestine, covered with simple columnar epithelium. Crypts of Lieberkuhn are moat-like invaginations of the epithelium around the villi that extend through the lamina propria down to the muscularis mucosae. Lymphocytes often invade the epithelium or form solitary lymphoid nodules in the lamina propria. Lymph nodules may form longitudinal aggregations of 30-50 nodules in the lamina propria of the ileum. These large aggregations are called Peyer's patches. The muscularis mucosae has two layers and extends into the intestinal villi, where the smooth muscle cells form a longitudinal bundle in the centre of the villi.

thymus,"Reticuloendothelial System, Thymus",1
thymus,"The thymus gland is part of the immune system. It is composed of lymphoid tissue and epithelial cells. It consists of two irregularly shaped lobes united by a connective tissue capsule. Each lobe is subdivided by connective tissue septa into lobules, which consist of an inner medullary zone, continuous with the medullae of adjacent lobules, and an outer cortical zone. The cortex is rich in lymphocytes (thymocytes) and the medulla in epithelial cells. This gland is supplied by the inferior thyroid and internal thoracic arteries, and its nerves are derived from the vagus and sympathetic nerves. The thymus is the site of T-lymphocyte production, necessary in early life for the normal development of immunological function. The thymus reaches its greatest relative weight shortly after birth and its greatest absolute weight and maximal development at puberty. It then begins to involute resulting in a slow decline of immune function throughout adulthood.",1
skin,"The liquid secreted by the sweat glands, having a salty taste and a pH that varies from 4.5 to 7.5. Sweat produced by the eccrine sweat glands is clear with a faint characteristic odor, and contains water, sodium chloride, and traces of albumin, urea, and other compounds. Its composition varies with many factors, e.g., fluid intake, external temperature and humidity, and some hormonal activity. Sweat produced by the larger, deeper, apocrine sweat glands of the axillae contains, in addition, organic material which on bacterial decomposition produces an offensive odor.",0

erector spinae,"The Muscle Spindle is composed of intrafusal fibers that are located within and run parallel to the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscle. When the extrafusal fibers are stretched, the intrafusal fibers of the spindle stretch as well. When stretching occurs, the sensory neuron from the muscle spindle signals the motor neurons located within the ventral horn of the spinal cord. This signal causes the motor neurons to fire, resulting in contraction of the muscle. This reflex arc provides negative feedback. The muscular contraction induced by the stretching works against or negates further muscle stretch. This mechanism helps to maintain proper muscle tension or tone. Although the muscle spindle helps to maintain proper muscle tension, unlike the Golgi tendon organ, it is not an indicator of muscle tension, but rather of muscle length.",0

small intestine submucosa,"Mucosa arranged into two fundamental structures - villi and crypts of Lieberkuhn. Villi are projections into the lumen of the small intestine, covered with simple columnar epithelium. Crypts of Lieberkuhn are moat-like invaginations of the epithelium around the villi that extend through the lamina propria down to the muscularis mucosae. Lymphocytes often invade the epithelium or form solitary lymphoid nodules in the lamina propria. Lymph nodules may form longitudinal aggregations of 30-50 nodules in the lamina propria of the ileum. These large aggregations are called Peyer's patches. The muscularis mucosae has two layers and extends into the intestinal villi, where the smooth muscle cells form a longitudinal bundle in the centre of the villi. The small intestinal mucosa secretes gastrin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin and secretin.",0

It is composed of a dorsal stratum of closely spaced pigmented cells, the pars compacta, and a larger ventral region of widely scattered cells, the pars reticulata. The pars compacta includes numerous cells that project forward to the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and contain dopamine, which acts as the primary neurotransmitter at the synaptic endings. Other, apparently non-dopaminergic cells project to portions of the ventral nucleus of thalamus, the superior colliculus and reticular formation. The nigrostriatal projection is reciprocated by a striatonigral fiber system with multiple neurotransmitters, chief among which is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

neck muscle,Muscle Spindle,0
neck muscle,"The Muscle Spindle is composed of intrafusal fibers that are located within and run parallel to the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscle. When the extrafusal fibers are stretched, the intrafusal fibers of the spindle stretch as well. When stretching occurs, the sensory neuron from the muscle spindle signals the motor neurons located within the ventral horn of the spinal cord. This signal causes the motor neurons to fire, resulting in contraction of the muscle. This reflex arc provides negative feedback. The muscular contraction induced by the stretching works against or negates further muscle stretch. This mechanism helps to maintain proper muscle tension or tone. Although the muscle spindle helps to maintain proper muscle tension, unlike the Golgi tendon organ, it is not an indicator of muscle tension, but rather of muscle length.",0

The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known. (from Diabetes Dictionary: http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/dictionary)",0

The pars compacta includes numerous cells that project forward to the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and contain dopamine, which acts as the primary neurotransmitter at the synaptic endings. Other, apparently non-dopaminergic cells project to portions of the ventral nucleus of thalamus, the superior colliculus and reticular formation. The nigrostriatal projection is reciprocated by a striatonigral fiber system with multiple neurotransmitters, chief among which is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin.

ovary follicle,"A cuboidal cell derived from a spindle-shaped granulosa cell precursor. Initially, ovarian granulosa cells create a single layer surrounding an oocyte. The oocyte and its single layer of ovarian granulosa cells make up a primary follicle. Proliferation of the ovarian granulosa cells leads to multiple cell layers surrounding the oocyte and maturation into a secondary follicle. The granulosa cells extend cytoplasmic processes to form gestational gap-junction-like unions with the plasma membrane of the oocyte. The continued growth of the ovarian granulosa cells takes the oocyte to the Graafian follicle stage. Once ovulation occurs, the granulosa cells become part of the corpus luteum. A major function of an ovarian granulosa cell is hormone production and secretion.",0
