Through direct attachment to the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus also meters secretions controlling water balance and milk production in the female. The role of the hypothalamus in awareness of pleasure and pain is well established in the laboratory. It is involved in the expression of emotions, such as fear and rage, and in sexual behaviors. Despite its numerous vital functions, the hypothalamus in humans accounts for only 1/300 of total brain weight, and is about the size of an almond. Structurally, it is joined to the thalamus; the two work together to monitor the sleep-wake cycle."

Each lobe is subdivided by connective tissue septa into lobules, which consist of an inner medullary zone, continuous with the medullae of adjacent lobules, and an outer cortical zone. The cortex is rich in lymphocytes (thymocytes) and the medulla in epithelial cells. This gland is supplied by the inferior thyroid and internal thoracic arteries, and its nerves are derived from the vagus and sympathetic nerves. The thymus is the site of T-lymphocyte production, necessary in early life for the normal development of immunological function. The thymus reaches its greatest relative weight shortly after birth and its greatest absolute weight and maximal development at puberty. It then begins to involute resulting in a slow decline of immune function throughout adulthood."

http://human.owl#NCI_C13824,"Muscle Spindles Muscle Spindle The Muscle Spindle is composed of intrafusal fibers that are located within and run parallel to the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscle. When the extrafusal fibers are stretched, the intrafusal fibers of the spindle stretch as well. When stretching occurs, the sensory neuron from the muscle spindle signals the motor neurons located within the ventral horn of the spinal cord. This signal causes the motor neurons to fire, resulting in contraction of the muscle. This reflex arc provides negative feedback. The muscular contraction induced by the stretching works against or negates further muscle stretch. This mechanism helps to maintain proper muscle tension or tone. Although the muscle spindle helps to maintain proper muscle tension, unlike the Golgi tendon organ, it is not an indicator of muscle tension, but rather of muscle length."
